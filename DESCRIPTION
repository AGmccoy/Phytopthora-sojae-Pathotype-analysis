Description: Provides tools for analysis of Phytophthora sojae survey data.  
  Functions provide distribution of susceptibilities, distribution of
  complexities with statistics, pathotype frequency distribution, as well as
  diversity indices for pathotypes.  This package is meant to be a direct
  replacement for the 'HaGiS' spreadsheet previously used for 'P. sojae'
  pathotype analysis and provide the same necessary data as the 'HaGiS'
  spreadsheet, doi:10.1046/j.1365-3059.1999.00325.x.
