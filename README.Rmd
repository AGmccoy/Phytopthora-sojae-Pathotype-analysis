# hagis

[![Project Status: WIP – Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

The goal of _hagis_ is to provide _Phytophthora sojae_ pathotype analysis that the original [HaGiS worksheet](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1365-3059.1999.00325.x) (Herrmann, Löwer and Schachtel) provided.

## Installation

Currently you can only install _hagis_ from GitHub with:

``` r
if (!require("remotes")) {
  install.packages("remotes", repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com/")
  library("remotes")
}

install_github("openplantpathology/hagis", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

The original R scripts were produced by Austin McCoy and Zachary Noel at Michigan State University to replicate the HaGiS worksheet and provide all necessary results for pathotype data analysis in R in addition to other tools to assist in the analysis of these data.

_Phytophthora sojae_ has been managed primarily via deployment of resistance genes (_Rps_ genes, resistance to _Phytophthora sojae_) in commercial soybean cultivars and by the application of fungicide seed treatments. However, repeated use of resistance genes can cause populations to adapt over time rendering these resistance genes ineffective. To determine current effectiveness of resistance genes for managing Phytophthora sojae, state-wide surveys must be conducted to determine the pathotype (previously referred to as "race") structure within sampled population of _P. sojae_.

The goal of these scripts was to provide all the necessary analyses needed when conducting a _Phytophthora sojae_ pathotype survey, including: distribution of susceptibilities (effective and non-effective _Rps_ genes), distribution of pathotype complexities with statistics, pathotype frequency distribution, as well as diversity indices for pathotypes.

Users may refer to the example file, `system.file("extdata", "practice_data_set.csv", package = "hagis")` and the documentation for further examples.
