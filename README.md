## Introduction

The goal of {hagis} is to provide analysis tools for plant pathogens
with gene-for-gene interactions in the R programming language that the
original [Habgood-Gilmour Spreadsheet,
HaGiS](https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3059.1999.00325.x), (Herrmann,
Löwer and Schachtel) provided.

This R package has been published in *MPMI* as a resource announcement
[(McCoy *et al.* 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-07-19-0180-A). You
may wish to refer to that paper for further information on this package.

## Overview

{hagis} was initially created for *Phytophthora sojae* surveys by
Dr. Austin McCoy and Dr. Zachary Noel at Michigan State University in
the US, where the disease has been managed primarily via deployment of
resistance genes (*Rps* genes, resistance to *P. sojae*) in commercial
soybean cultivars and by the application of fungicide seed treatments.
However, repeated use of resistance genes can cause populations to adapt
over time rendering these resistance genes ineffective. To determine
current effectiveness of resistance genes for managing *P. sojae*,
state-wide surveys (in the US) are conducted to determine the pathotype
(previously referred to as “race”) structure within sampled population
of *P. sojae*.

However, the package is not only useful for *P. sojae* work. It was
built to be useful for other plant pathogen gene-for-gene interaction
systems, *e.g.* rusts or canola blackleg, *Leptosphaeria maculans*. The
goal of this package is to provide all the necessary analyses needed
when conducting a pathotype surveys, including: distribution of
susceptibilities (effective and non-effective resistance genes),
distribution of pathotype complexities with statistics, pathotype
frequency distribution, as well as diversity indices for pathotypes in
an efficient and reproducible manner.

detailed information on how to use {hagis} along with working examples
using a built-in data set.

## Quick Start Install

### Stable Version

A stable version of {hagis} is available from CRAN.

``` r
install.packages("hagis")
```

### Development Version

A development version is available from from GitHub. If you wish to
install the development version that may have new features or bug fixes
before the CRAN version does (but also may not work properly), please
install the remotes package, available from CRAN. We strive to keep the
main branch on GitHub functional and working properly.

``` r
if (!require("remotes")) {
  install.packages("remotes", repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com/")
  library("remotes")
}

install_github("openplantpathology/hagis", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
