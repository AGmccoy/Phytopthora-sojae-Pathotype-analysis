# hagis (development version)

## Minor changes

* Sample names in `calculate_diversities()` are not required to be numeric values.
Previously, this column was converted to `numeric` so if `character` values were present, these values became `NA`.
This allows for greater flexibility when analysing the data as sample names are often more descriptive than just a numerical value.

* Spelling corrections in code comments

* Clean up CITATION file

* README is now more complete with information and links to the _MPMI_ paper

# hagis 3.1.2

## Minor changes

* Improved documentation formatting

* Update roxygen details

* Fixes incomplete end of line in test-create_binary_matrix.R

* Add wordlist of allowed words for spellchecking

* More consistent code styling in vignettes

* Prefer "_" to "*" for _italics_

* More verbose handling of importing _data.table_ as a whole package using "R/utils-data.table.R" in place of "R/zzz.R"

# hagis 3.1.1

## Minor Changes

* Use _ape_, _vegan_, _dplyr_ and _vidiffr_ packages conditionally

* Remove _covr_ from Suggests

* Better documentation formatting

# hagis 3.1.0

## Major Changes

* Add new function, `create_binary_matrix()` to format data for exporting beta diversity matrices representing the pathotype of each isolate.
Users can export a binary pathotype data matrix which could then be used to visualize beta-diversity of pathotypes using _vegan_ or _ape_ in R

* Add new vignette, "Beta-diversity Analyses", to illustrate the use of the new functionality

## Minor Changes

* Use ROxygen 7.1.1

* Spell check and correct spelling errors

# hagis 3.0.1

## Minor Changes

* Update citation with full MPMI citation

* Fix issue in CITATION file where `nasapower` was referred to in text

* Use ROxygen 7.0.0

* Remove an extra "/" in the CITATION's DOI

# hagis 3.0.0

## Defunct functions

* `plot()` is now defunct. Use `autoplot()` to plot _hagis_ objects in place of `plot()`.
This is to avoid the side-effect of generating and displaying a plot every time `plot()` is called, which can be troublesome when using _ggplot2_ themes since it created two plots, the original with the base theme and the new themed plot

## Minor Changes
 
* Rename output column `N_susc` to `N_virulent_isolates`

* Don't round results from `summarize_gene()` or `calculate_complexities()`
before returning values to user

* Implement fix suggested by @zkamvar to ensure that the user-input data is not changed from a `data.frame` or `tibble` object to a `data.table` object in the R session

* Add ability to sort graph x-axis in ascending or descending order based on the y-axis values rather than only by gene or complexity.

* Move example data set into internal data and provide documentation for them

* Provide documentation for how diversity indices are calculated along with mathematical notation where possible to display

* Calculate Shannon and Simpson indices internally rather than rely on _vegan_ to reduce number of Dependencies

* Replace the term `field` with `column` in documentation

* Test coverage now 100 %

* Add funding agencies to DESCRIPTION Authors@R field

# hagis 2.0.0

* Initial CRAN release

* Completely new R-package format rather than just Rmd and script files

# hagis 1.0.0

* Initial release of Rmd and script files by A. McCoy and Z. Noel
